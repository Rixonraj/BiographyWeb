                <h3>Career as a scientist</h3>
                <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                    Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                    Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                    Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft but remained
                    unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working
                    under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian
                    Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite
                    Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in
                    July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in
                    1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more
                    engineers.</p>
                <h3>Presidency</h3>
                <p>Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential
                    election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His
                    term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007. During his term as president, he was affectionately
                    known as the People's President, saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest
                    decision he had taken during his tenure. Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate
                    of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure. Article 72 of the
                    Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant pardons and suspend or commute the
                    death sentence of convicts on death row. Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure
                    as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged. Perhaps the
                    most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the
                    December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of
                    India in 2004.</p>
